PGDSpider is a utility for preparing various data files in population genetics.
Here, we have used it to prepare input for STRUCTURE and Arlequin, which we both
needed to use at multiple stages of our analysis (both data cleaning and various
population structure calculations).

- [ratsSNPs_PGDSpider_input.txt](ratsSNPs_PGDSpider_input.txt) - intermediately
  clean file, from which inputs where created in the further data cleaning 
  stage, to detect outliers in terms of HW equilibrium and ancestry structure.
- [ratsSNPs_PGDSpider_input_CLEAN.txt](ratsSNPs_PGDSpider_input_CLEAN.txt) -
  clean clean file, which we used for the multi-stage STRUCTURE calculations
  and island-to-island F~st~ calculations.
- [PGDSpider_log.spid](PGDSpider_log.spid)
