# Genomic signatures of the Polynesian rat _Rattus exulans_ retrace the Austronesian expansion

This repository contains scripts and data for the analysis of SNPs genotyped in 
accessions of the Polynesian rat _Rattus exulans_. De input data were produced
using a [KASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompetitive_allele_specific_PCR)
pipeline as implemented by the Institute of Biology Leiden based on primers
designed from genome sequencing of 8 _R. exulans_ specimens. That earlier
genome assembly and primer design is contained within another git repository
located [here](https://github.com/naturalis/changing-invaders).
